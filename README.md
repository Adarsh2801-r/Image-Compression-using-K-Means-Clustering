# Image-Compression-using-K-Means-Clustering

Image Compression is a form of data compression applied to digital images to reduce storage space and storage/transmission cost. We are using K-Means Clustering Algorithm to compress a png file. 

Space occupied by original image was 1.78M whereas space occupied by compressed image was around 248K.
